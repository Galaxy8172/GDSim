# GDSim: Accurate simulation for Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Multiple Deep Generative Adversarial Networks
The emergence of single-cell transcriptome sequencing has revealed cellular heterogeneity and allows for the analysis of cellular developmental processes at the individual cell level. Despite its significant potential, challenges such as technical limitations, high costs, and the scarcity of certain samples result in some scRNA-seq data being insufficient. Consequently, when utilizing downstream analysis software to address such issues, there is a lack of sufficient baseline data or an inadequate number of training samples for training large biological models. This study introduces an innovative deep generative network named GDSim for the simulation generation of scRNA-seq data. GDSim is based on a diffusion model that enables the exploration of deep gene expression dependencies within scRNA-seq data, aiming to generate simulated data that closely aligns with the distribution of the original data. Experimental results demonstrate that GDSim exhibits high accuracy in recovering data distribution characteristics, surpassing currently state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, it demonstrates a high level of consistency with the original data in terms of cell subtype clustering and gene differential expression analysis.
## 描述
The input to scMultiGAN is a pre-processed count single cell matrix, with columns representing cells and rows representing genes. It's output is an imputed count matrix with the same dimension. The complete pipeline and the datasets used in the paper is described with the following image.
